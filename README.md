## About 

This repo shows all the algorithms i am currently working on or have worked on before
There will be short explanations covering each topic, few example codes and the answers to the questions
that might pop up.

The book i am referring to is Introduction to Algorithms(Fourth Edition).
It is written by 4 authors,
1. Thomas H. Cormen
2. Charles E. Leiserson
3. Ronald L. Rivest
4. Clifford Stein
which is why the book is also reffered to as CLRS.
