Divide and conquer/ Recursion:

Divide and conquer is a 3 step method to solve an algorithm effecitvely

1) divide
2) conquer
3) combine

We first divide the input into smaller subsets of the input, perform any calculation on that reduced data set and then
combine the final data to get a better asymptotic time.

Recursion: 

Recursion is an example of a divide and conquer algorithm

the way recursion works is simple, let us say we have a function RecurFunc(n);
which takes n, which is the size of data as input

the function calls itself with a reduced data inside the function itself

RecurFunc(n){
	if BaseCase == True:
		//perform calculations
		return value;
	else:
		RecurFunc(n/x);
}

where n/x is any reduced data set
it need not be n/x alone it can also be something like (n-1); where the reduction is constant.


Recursion follows two simple steps:

1) base case
2) reduce case

Let us assume that we have a data set of size n0. 
Any reduction of data is represented as n1,n2,n3... etc. (say nx in general) 

1) BASE case:
	at this level, the data set is at its lowest possible form
	we can say that nx cannot be reduced anymore and the calculations must be performed on this given
	amount of data nx.
	if we have reduced data until, say n7, we cannot reduce the data anymore, ie n8 does not exist. 
	this may be due to the fact that the data cannot be reduced at all, or it makes no sense to reduce it further.

	any function call must fail this case to go to the reduce case.

2) REDUCE case:
	at this level, the data can be processed further by reducing it, this case will keep running until
	the data reaches the base case.
