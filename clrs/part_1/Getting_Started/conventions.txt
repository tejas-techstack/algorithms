Pseudocode: Piece of code that has all the logical components of any programming language, but does not represent
	    any singular programming language

loop invariant: It is the state of the system at any given instant.

a loop invariant is true, if at each instant considered, the loop invariant is following the logic
stated by the algorithm. if at any given instant the loop invariant is not doing what the logic intends to,
it is false and the algorithm being used is incorrect.

it is termed invariant for this purpose, it is always true, not changing.

There are 3 main steps to ensure if any given algorithm is correct

1. Initialization - the invariant is true before the first iteration
2. Maintenance - if it is true before the iteration, it should remain true before the next iteration
3. Termination - invariant should remain true, and also show definite properties that indicate that the end goal
		 has been reached


INSERTION SORT

keys: the numbers to be sorted
satellite data: keys that are associated with each other form satellite data
record: together these two form a record

how does insertion sort work?

lets say we have a set of numbers 5, 4, 6, 3, 1, 2

let us assume they are kept in boxes that donot move, only the numbers inside them do. 
the boxes are named A,B,C so on.

we move from left to right, comparing the number of the current box with each of the boxes to its left.

let us consider box A, since there is no box next to it we move to the next box, box B, we see that 4<5 so we move 4 to
box A and 5 to box B. the current numbers are 4, 5, 6, 3, 1, 2
 
then we check box C, and compare it to box A and box B, we see that the number in box C is greater so we donot do anything. The state is 4, 5, 6, 3, 1, 2.

then we check box D, we see that 3 is lesser than 4, so we put 3 in box A and move all the other numbers by 1 box, ie 
3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2.

we then move to box E, we see that 1 is smaller than 3, so we move 1 to box A and all the other numbers by 1 box, ie
1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2.

we then move to the last box, we see that 2 is smaller than 3 but bigger than 1, so we move 2 to box B, and move all the other numbers by 1 box.

hence we get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

at any given instant we see that the boxes left of the currently selected box is always arranged in ascending order.

MERGE SORT

-it is a divide and conquer method
