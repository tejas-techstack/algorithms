what are asymptotic notations:

asymptotic notations are basically time-bounds on the run time of the algorithm. Basically if we have a function
say f(x), that represents the run time of the algorithm, x represents the amount of data. 

an asymptotic notation provides a bound for this function, such that the function does not cross the bound and is 
limited by it, although this applies only for large values of input data. 


there are 3 main asymptotic notations:

1. O-notation (O)
2. Omega-notation (Om)
3. Theta-notation (0)

1. O-notation
	-provides an upper bound on the function.
	-there exists a positive constant c and n0 for which 
		0 <= f(n) <= cg(n); for all n >= n0;
2. Om-notation
	-provides a lower bound on the funciton.
	-there exists aa positive constant c and n0 for which
		ch(n) <= f(n) <= INF; for all n >= n0;

3. Theta-notation (0)
	-provides a tight bound on the function.
	-there exists a positive constant c1, c2 and n0 for which
		c1h(n) <= f(n) <= c2g(n); for all n >= n0;

In all practicallity, these concepts are purely conceptual.
we generally use the O-notation as we generally only need an upper bound for a function and a lower bound is practically not useful. And for this reason defining a theta-notation is also of little use. 

there are also two others lesser used notations called o-notation and w-notations.
