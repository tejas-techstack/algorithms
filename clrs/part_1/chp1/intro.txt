what is an algorithm?

input-process-output.
these are the three main functions of any piece of software

an algorithm is a set of instructions, that can process "n" amount of data in a predefinied time.

in simpler words, given an arbitrary size of input, the amount of time taken to process it is definied
by the size of the input.

mathematically representing it, if we have x instructions and the algorithm can solve xlogx instructions per second

it will take x/xlogx seconds for the entire data set to finish being processed.
